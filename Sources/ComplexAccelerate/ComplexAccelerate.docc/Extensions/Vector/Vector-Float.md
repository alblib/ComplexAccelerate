#  Vector<Float>
Parallel operation specialization when `Element` is `Float`.

## Overview

This specialization is basically redefinition of `Accelerate.vDSP` and `Accelerate.vForce`. 
This is introduced to implement the general parallel operation structure ``Vector`` with general type arguments given.

## Topics
### Parallel Arithmetics
- ``Vector/add(_:_:)-60afc``
- ``Vector/subtract(_:_:)-3br1h``
- ``Vector/multiply(_:_:)-7ixhb``
- ``Vector/divide(_:_:)-6p7p2``

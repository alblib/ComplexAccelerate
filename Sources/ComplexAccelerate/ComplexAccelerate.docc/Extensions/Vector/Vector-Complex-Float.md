#  Vector<Complex<Float>>
Parallel operation specialization on complex numbers when `Element` is ``Complex``â€‰`<Float>`.

## Overview

This specialization provides convenient Swift-styled parallel computations on complex numbers,
which is defined in `Accelerate.vDSP_z...`. 
As parallel mathematical functions on complex array is not defined by system,
we defined such functions using `vForce` functions.
